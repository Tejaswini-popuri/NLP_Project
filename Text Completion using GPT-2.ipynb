real, but the rings are rendered with a GAN in real-time. A first network detects where to render the ring, a second network does the rendering. There's no 3D model, it's purely 2D to 2D.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\n\\nWe thought we'd share some technical details since the underlying code, JoliGAN is Open Source, [\\n\\n\\\\- The GAN uses a combination of mobile ResNets with attention as a Generator, along with a projected Discriminator \\\\[1\\\\]. Depending on the stone, we sometimes use transformers as well (customized Segformers and ViT mostly). A series of additional neural networks act as semantic constraints to the space of GAN transforms.\\n\\n\\\\- Real-time is achieved through our full C++ Open Source backend DeepDetect, [ We use CUDA along with OpenCV and TensorRT to chain multiple models (ring detection and generator mostly), and we make sure the data remain within CUDA memory at all time. This allows us to reach \\\\~60 FPS on 1080Ti and 20% more on average on an  RTX3090.\\n\\nJoliGAN is a powerful tool for domain to domain adaptation, with applications to AR, dataset augmentation, and sim2real transformation mostly.
